# Search
This is a front-end design for Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search. 
It's my first project of the CS50's Web Programming course. I did it using CSS and HTML.
I tried to match Googleâ€™s aesthetics as best as possible.

All the project was done only with educational purposes.
